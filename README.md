# Text Editor Backend - Node.js, Express.js & MongoDB

This repository is a part of the course JSRamverk at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH).
All supporting development work, examples and course guidance is provided by [Emil Folino](https://github.com/emilfolino?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=me-&type=&language=) of the faculty [DBWebb-team](https://dbwebb.se/).  

In this part of the course, starting from part 2 of 7, we begin working with backend developement using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) together with the [Express.js]() framework. 
As we go along we learn to implement database use for our [text editors from the first part of the course](https://github.com/DMoest/editor-frontend-vue) with NoSQL using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). 
Last but not least we learn to build a connection between Backend API and the [frontend Application](https://github.com/DMoest/editor-frontend-vue). 

This is the second part of the course and here we learn the basics of building a backend API.
